# My first Angular app
 This app is a training course from the pluralsight platform. The training is called *[Angular: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-2-getting-started-update/table-of-contents)* and produced by [Deborah Kurata](https://github.com/DeborahK). I highly recommend this training to anyone wishing to learn the basics of Angular.
